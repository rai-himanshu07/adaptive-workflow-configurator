# Plan Task

Use the text following `/plan-task` as the task. If none is supplied, use
`docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` when present; otherwise ask for the task. Do not implement
the task. This skill is user-invoked, not part of Velocity's default path.

1. When required by the active memory policy, call `mempalace_status`, inspect
   relevant `/memories/repo/` notes, and read
   `docs/MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md` plus `docs/HANDOFF.md`.
2. Call `mempalace_diary_read` for agent `copilot` with wing
   `{{MEMORY_WING}}`, then use the same wing for `mempalace_search` for
   prior decisions and synthesis. If the handoff is missing, stale, or
   contradicted, query Chronicle before broad code exploration. Declare
   `MEMORY DEGRADED` if required memory access fails.
3. Read `AGENTS.md`. Use codebase-memory for structure and impact, checking
   freshness and coverage, then read only nearby live implementation and tests
   needed to plan. Declare `CODE GRAPH DEGRADED` when the graph is unavailable.
4. Create `docs/plans/plan-YYYYMMDD-TASK-SLUG.md` from
   `docs/PLAN.template.md`.
5. Include goal, acceptance criteria, non-goals, evidence, decisions, risks,
   ordered steps, dependencies, touched files, and verification per step.
6. Set the new plan's status to `draft`.
7. Replace the Active plan value in `docs/HANDOFF.md` with the exact new path.
8. Return the path and ask the user to approve or amend it.

Only the new plan and the handoff's Active plan value may be edited.
